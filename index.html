            Drowning in the Blue Nile
            He sent me Downtown Lights
            I hadn't heard it in a while
            My boredom's bone deep
            This cage was once just fine
            Am I allowed to cry?
            
            I dream of cracking locks
            Throwing my life to the wolves, or the ocean rocks
            Crashing into him tonight, he's a paradox
            I'm seeing visions, am I bad? Or mad? Or wise?
            
            What if he's written mine on my upper thigh only in my mind?
            One slip and falling back into the hedge maze, oh, what a way to die
            I keep recalling things we never did
            Messy top lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
            Without ever touching his skin
            How can I be guilty as sin?
            
            I keep these longings locked in lowercase inside a vault
            Someone told me: There's no such thing as bad thoughts, only your actions talk
            These fatal fantasies giving way to labored breath
            Taking all of me, we've already done it in my head
            If it's make believe, why does it feel like a vow
            We'll both uphold somehow?
            
            What if he's written mine on my upper thigh only in my mind?
            One slip and falling back into the hedge maze, oh, what a way to die
            My bedsheets are ablaze, I screamed his name
            Building up like waves crashing over my grave
            Without ever touching his skin
            How can I be guilty as sin?
            
            What if I roll the stone away?
            They're gonna crucify me anyway
            What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?
            If long suffering propriety is what they want from me
            They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly
            I choose you and me, religiously
            
            What if he's written mine on my upper thigh only in my mind?
            One slip and falling back into the hedge maze, oh, what a way to die
            I keep recalling things we never did
            Messy top lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
            Without ever touching his skin
            How can I be guilty as sin?
            
            He sent me Downtown Lights
            I hadn't heard it in a while
            Am I allowed to cry?
